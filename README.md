## New IDE Requirements Document (requirements.md)

---

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a next-generation Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed to address pain points in existing tools and leverage emerging trends in programming, including AI/LLM integration, real-time collaboration, API-first workflows, live previews, and embedded database management.

### 2. Purpose & Scope

* **Purpose:** Define functional and non-functional requirements for a new IDE that empowers developers to code faster, smarter, and more collaboratively.

* **Scope:**

* **Desktop (Windows & macOS):** Native Electron-based applications with platform‑specific installers (MSI/EXE for Windows, DMG/Mac App Store support for macOS).

* **Web:** Browser-based IDE option for quick access without installation.

### 3. Stakeholders

* **Primary Users:** Software engineers, full-stack developers, data scientists, DevOps engineers.
* **Secondary Users:** QA engineers, technical writers, product managers.

### 4. Pain Points in Existing IDEs

1. **Slow Startup & Resource Usage**
   • Long load times, high memory/CPU demands.
2. **Limited AI Assistance**
   • Basic code completion (IntelliSense) lacks deeper context understanding.
3. **Fragmented Tooling**
   • Switching between terminals, database GUIs, API testers, documentation viewers.
4. **Poor Live Feedback**
   • No integrated live preview for web/UIs or real-time code execution.
5. **Inadequate Collaboration**
   • Limited synchronous editing, lacks rich code review workflows.
6. **Weak API & Dependency Management**
   • No built-in API catalog or versioned dependency visualization.
7. **Basic Database Integration**
   • External tools required for querying and schema design.

### 5. Key New Features

#### 5.1 AI & LLM Integration

* **Contextual Code Generation:** Leverage large language models for boilerplate, complex algorithms, and refactoring suggestions.
* **Natural-Language Queries:** Query codebase, APIs, database schema using plain English.
* **Automated Documentation:** Generate inline comments, README files, and code summaries on demand.

\| FR9  | Role-based access control for multi-user projects.                                           |
\| FR10 | Support for interactive notebook files (.ipynb) with cell execution, outputs, and diffing.  |
\| FR11 | Kernel management enabling GPU/CPU selection and remote cluster execution.                   |
\| FR12 | Embedded data visualization components for ML data inspection and plotting.               |
\| FR13 | Experiment tracking integration for recording metrics, hyperparameters, and artifacts.    |
API-First Workflow

* **API Catalog & Playground:** Discover, test (send requests), and mock REST/GraphQL endpoints within IDE.
* **Auto-generated Clients:** Generate SDKs or request snippets for supported languages.

#### 5.4 Integrated Database Tooling

* **Schema Designer:** Visual ER diagrams, migrations, and version control integration.
* **Query Editor:** Syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and result visualization embedded in-editor.

#### 5.5 Collaboration & Versioning

* **Live Share:** Low-latency co-editing with synced terminals, previews, and chat.
* **Peer Review:** Inline code review, annotations, and threaded comments.

#### 5.6 Extensibility & Plugins

* **Plugin Marketplace:** Discover and install community/contributed plugins and themes.
* **Customizable Workspaces:** Save and switch between workspace layouts and task profiles.

#### 5.7 Autonomous AI Agent Integration

* **Task Automation Agents:** Configure agents to perform routine tasks (e.g., refactoring, testing, deployment) based on triggers or schedules.
* **Conversational Assistant Panel:** Context-aware chat interface powered by LLMs, offering suggestions, diagnostics, and step-by-step guidance.
* **Workflow Orchestration:** Define multi-step agent workflows that interact with APIs, databases, build systems, and version control to automate end-to-end processes.

### 6. Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements

| ID  | Requirement                                                                      |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR1 | IDE must load within 3 seconds on modern hardware.                               |
| FR2 | Provide AI-assisted code completion with 90% accuracy in context.                |
| FR3 | Support in-IDE live preview for React, Vue, Angular, and static HTML/CSS.        |
| FR4 | Built-in REPL interface for JavaScript, Python, and SQL.                         |
| FR5 | Offer an API catalog with search, request builder, and mock server capabilities. |
| FR6 | Visual database schema editor supporting at least PostgreSQL and MySQL.          |
| FR7 | Real-time collaborative editing with conflict resolution and chat.               |
| FR8 | Plugin system with documented SDK for extensions.                                |
| FR9 | Role-based access control for multi-user projects.                               |

### 7. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** Max memory usage per project: 1 GB, CPU idle overhead <5%.
* **Scalability:** Support codebases up to 100K lines without perceptible lag.
* **Security:** Encrypt AI prompts, secure credential storage (2FA support).
* **Cross-Platform:** Full support for Windows 10/11 and macOS 11+ with unified codebase, platform‑specific auto‑update and signing processes for both environments.
* **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard-first navigation.
